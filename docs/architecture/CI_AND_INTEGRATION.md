# CI and Integration Infrastructure (WU-5)

Status: describes the CI workflow and the real-database Integration infrastructure introduced by WU-5. It is infrastructure, not a support claim. MySQL and MariaDB remain design targets ([DATABASE_SUPPORT_AND_TEST_POLICY.md](./DATABASE_SUPPORT_AND_TEST_POLICY.md)); the version cells below are the test matrix ratified in [DEC-013](../decisions/DEC-013-test-only-database-version-boundary.md) (the MySQL `8.0.16` minimum is also [DEC-008](../decisions/DEC-008-database-engine-targets-and-verification-policy.md)); they are not support ranges. The Integration tests prove properties of the real servers and of `pdo_mysql`. They do not verify any Transaction, Ordering or Pagination behavior of this package, because none of it exists yet.

## 1. Local and CI parity

Every CI gate runs a repository-owned command that a developer can run locally with the same verification contract.

| Gate | Local command | CI job |
|---|---|---|
| Composer validation | `composer validate --strict` | Static checks |
| Dependency resolution (no committed lock) | `composer update --prefer-stable` (latest) or `composer update --prefer-lowest --prefer-stable` (lowest) | Static checks, Compat |
| Platform requirements, nothing ignored | `composer check-platform-reqs` | Static checks, Compat |
| Strict PSR-4 | `composer dump-autoload --optimize --strict-psr` | Static checks |
| PHP syntax | `composer syntax` | Static checks |
| Whitespace | `composer whitespace` | Static checks |
| Dependency policy audit | `composer audit --no-interaction --abandoned=fail` (Composer 2.10+) | Compat (all four cells) |
| Static analysis | `composer analyse` | Compat |
| Code style and PER-CS 3.1 | `composer format:check` | Compat |
| Unit suite | `composer test:unit` | Compat |
| Regression suite | `composer test:regression` | Compat |
| Integration suite (real database) | `composer test:integration` | Integration |
| Complete suite | `composer test` (unit, regression, then integration) | all of the above |
| Workflow lint | `actionlint` over `.github/workflows` | Workflow lint |

Unit and Regression need no Docker. `composer test` includes Integration through the same `composer test:integration` orchestration; it has no second lifecycle.

## 2. Integration lifecycle

`composer test:integration` runs `scripts/integration.php` (functions in `scripts/integration-support.php`, which the regression suite exercises without Docker):

```text
validate prerequisites (docker, compose, daemon, ext-pdo_mysql, vendor)
→ resolve the cell from docker/integration-matrix.json (allowlist; image pinned by tag and digest)
→ docker compose up --wait on compose.integration.yaml (unique project, loopback dynamic port)
→ service health check, then a PDO probe loop with a deadline
→ verify SELECT VERSION() against the cell
→ run the Integration suite
→ residue check: no tables in the schema, no open InnoDB transaction
→ run the suite again on the same service (repeatability)
→ docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans, always, then verify that no container, volume or network of the project remains
```

Commands:

```bash
composer test:integration                      # default cell, one fresh lifecycle, two suite passes
PP_DB_CELL=mariadb-11.8.9 composer test:integration
composer test:integration -- --cell=mysql-8.0.16 --fresh-runs=2 --suite-passes=2
```

Every external command has a deadline (120 s by default, the teardown commands `PP_TEARDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, 180 s by default, startup and the suite the two settings above). A command that exceeds it is sent SIGTERM, killed after a 5 s grace period and reported with status 124; the lifecycle then ends as an infrastructure failure (exit `3`) after the same teardown.

The whole run also has an overall budget, `PP_TOTAL_BUDGET_SECONDS` (default 1500 s). Work never uses the part of the budget reserved for cleanup (`PP_TEARDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` plus 30 s): every command timeout is cut to what remains, and no new lifecycle or suite pass starts once nothing remains. The Integration job timeout (40 minutes) is sized for budget + reserve + 10 minutes of setup, so GitHub cannot end the job before the runner reaches its own teardown; a regression test enforces that relation. `docker compose down` is retried once, and a `down` that still fails makes the teardown fail even when the follow-up resource queries are empty, so `TEARDOWN VERIFIED` is only printed when `down` succeeded and no container, volume or network of the project remains.

Options: `--cell=<key>` (or `PP_DB_CELL`), `--fresh-runs=<n>` independent lifecycles from a fresh service, `--suite-passes=<n>` suite executions per lifecycle. A cell that is not in the matrix is rejected; there is no free-form image, `latest` or floating tag. Exit status: `0` success, `1` test failure, `2` invalid usage or configuration, `3` infrastructure failure (missing prerequisite, unhealthy service, identity mismatch, teardown residue). Nothing is skipped silently: a missing prerequisite or a missing `PHP_PERSISTENCE_IT_*` variable fails.

The PHP runner stays on the host PHP so the PHP matrix is truthful; only the database runs in Docker. Credentials are random per run, scoped to a disposable service and never reused. Baseline CI needs no repository secrets.

### Environment

| Variable | Set by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PP_DB_CELL` | developer / CI | Cell key; defaults to `default` in the matrix |
| `PP_COMPOSE_PROJECT`, `PP_DB_IMAGE`, `PP_DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `PP_DB_DATABASE`, `PP_DB_USER`, `PP_DB_PASSWORD` | `scripts/integration.php` | Compose parameters of one lifecycle |
| `PP_UP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `PP_SUITE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `PP_TEARDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `PP_TOTAL_BUDGET_SECONDS` | developer / CI (optional) | Whole seconds, 1 to 9999, validated before anything starts. Deadline for `docker compose up --wait` including image pull (default 660), for one suite pass (default 900), for each teardown command (default 180) and for the whole run (default 1500, must exceed the teardown reserve) |
| `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM` | `scripts/integration.php` | Set only for a cell that has a single platform (`mysql-8.0.16`: `linux/amd64`) |
| `PHP_PERSISTENCE_IT_ENGINE`, `_EXPECTED_VERSION`, `_CELL`, `_HOST`, `_PORT`, `_DATABASE`, `_USER`, `_PASSWORD` | `scripts/integration.php` | Suite configuration; the suite fails when one is missing |

## 3. Test matrix

One parameterized Compose definition (`compose.integration.yaml`) serves every cell. The data is in `docker/integration-matrix.json`; images come from the Docker Official Images `mysql` and `mariadb` repositories on Docker Hub.

| Cell | Tier | Image (tag and index digest) | Platforms | CI | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mysql-8.0.16` | endpoint, oldest | `mysql:8.0.16@sha256:5d11283aee9b73509b737785e0ad79a2d9abf51f4abf3f221702a8add0e36bf2` | `linux/amd64` only | PHP 8.4, 8.5 | minimum ratified by DEC-008; test cell (DEC-013) |
| `mysql-8.4.13` | intermediate (LTS line) | `mysql:8.4.13@sha256:76f0358884cb92d9a086d24e5671c38048d3fef40f2588703d73eb55392d6b69` | amd64, arm64 | PHP 8.4 | ratified test cell (DEC-013) |
| `mysql-9.7.4` | endpoint, newest | `mysql:9.7.4@sha256:8fb11c38b3551e22d50adbb688f027f8ff4ea2d2445aa277c1cc97b4af85ec54` | amd64, arm64 | PHP 8.4, 8.5 | ratified test cell (DEC-013) |
| `mysql-26.10.0` | exploratory (Innovation) | `mysql:26.10.0@sha256:f51c9c01c16b0eb5d81bb70ab7e7fcb3b96abc6a54114be3a94e8e569cae7815` | amd64, arm64 | manual dispatch only, not required | exploratory |
| `mariadb-10.11.19` | endpoint, oldest | `mariadb:10.11.19@sha256:d769e37960821dfdcf096954f6e7ac89f747e116c1bba98e48edd265dfc7deae` | amd64, arm64, ppc64le, s390x | PHP 8.4, 8.5 | ratified test cell (DEC-013) |
| `mariadb-11.4.13` | intermediate (LTS line) | `mariadb:11.4.13@sha256:d1891ede5a559f1086f55053bb8cc1569b0298338c4d72d71725a7f74f6ba620` | same | PHP 8.4 | ratified test cell (DEC-013) |
| `mariadb-11.8.9` | intermediate (LTS line) | `mariadb:11.8.9@sha256:c4124d1afa875e47f2892edf26b482fa54f796e2f342d3717a04ca091a22a9bd` | same | PHP 8.4 | ratified test cell (DEC-013) |
| `mariadb-12.3.3` | endpoint, newest | `mariadb:12.3.3@sha256:d46e102fa8b9b72bfcdeb56f9dd538742092119dc8b11f31fe662605cd234cd9` | same | PHP 8.4, 8.5 | ratified test cell (DEC-013) |

PHP axis: the oldest supported minor `8.4` and the latest released minor `8.5` (current patches 8.4.27 and 8.5.12 observed on Docker Hub and php.net). Each engine endpoint runs on both PHP minors; the intermediate LTS cells run on `8.4` to avoid a full cross product without a risk that justifies it. Compat runs `{8.4, 8.5} × {latest, lowest}` dependencies. A passing cell is test evidence for that cell, not a support range; the declared range is not widened by this work unit.

### Image provenance evidence (2026-10-27)

- Every tag above exists in the official `library/mysql` and `library/mariadb` repositories (Docker Hub tag API), and every digest in the matrix is the index digest reported by the registry and by `docker pull`.
- `mysql:8.0.16` exists exactly (published 2019-07-17) and is a `linux/amd64`-only image. It runs natively on the amd64 GitHub runners and under emulation on arm64 hosts. No floating `8.0` tag is used and the ratified minimum is not changed.
- All images are pinned by `tag@digest`; a mutable tag alone is never used. Re-pinning is a deliberate change of `docker/integration-matrix.json` reviewed with its own evidence.
- The orchestration compares `SELECT VERSION()` with the cell's expected version and fails on a mismatch, so a retagged image cannot pass silently.

### Observed server facts (images of 2026-10-27, from the Integration runs)

| Cell | `SELECT VERSION()` | Default `innodb_snapshot_isolation` | Error `1020` with the setting ON | Locking read after an older snapshot with the setting OFF or absent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mysql-8.0.16`, `mysql-8.4.13`, `mysql-9.7.4`, `mysql-26.10.0` | `8.0.16`, `8.4.13`, `9.7.4`, `26.10.0` | variable absent | not applicable | sees the latest committed row |
| `mariadb-10.11.19` | `10.11.19-MariaDB-ubu2204` | `OFF` | raised | sees the latest committed row |
| `mariadb-11.4.13` | `11.4.13-MariaDB-ubu2404` | `OFF` | raised | sees the latest committed row |
| `mariadb-11.8.9` | `11.8.9-MariaDB-ubu2404` | `ON` | raised | sees the latest committed row |
| `mariadb-12.3.3` | `12.3.3-MariaDB-ubu2404` | `ON` | raised | sees the latest committed row |

"Raised" means a locking read and an `UPDATE` after an older `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot failed with driver error `1020` when the test set the session variable to `ON`. The tests set the variable only on their own connections of the disposable service. What the server does after `1020` (whether it already ended the transaction) is deliberately not asserted because it differs between versions; this remains an open point of DEC-009 and of the WU-8 contract.

## 4. Decision record

The Project Owner approved the test-only version boundary on 2026-10-27 exactly as recommended, and it is recorded in [DEC-013](../decisions/DEC-013-test-only-database-version-boundary.md) through the partial-ratification path of [DEC-009](../decisions/DEC-009-proposed-version-matrix-and-mariadb-snapshot-isolation.md): MySQL `8.0.16`, `8.4.13`, `9.7.4`; MariaDB `10.11.19`, `11.4.13`, `11.8.9`, `12.3.3`; MySQL Innovation `26.10.0` exploratory only; the upper edge capped at the highest verified endpoint. The MariaDB `1020` contract stays `PROPOSED`/`DEFERRED` in DEC-009. This is a decision about the test matrix, not a support claim.

## 5. Evidence

The evidence of the local matrix runs and of the CI runs is recorded in the pull request description, because it belongs to a specific commit.
