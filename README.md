Direct-PDO Transaction, Pagination, and Ordering utilities for MySQL and MariaDB.

</div>

---

## Overview

`maatify/php-persistence` is a small, direct-PDO toolkit with three independent capabilities over a **caller-supplied** `PDO` connection: running callbacks inside a transaction or a caller's savepoint (with optional bounded deadlock replay), parameterized whitelist-sorted bounded pagination, and locking next-position/move operations for integer display-order columns. It is developed as a separate package from the earlier, published `maatify/persistence` ([coexistence rules](docs/decisions/DEC-005-coexistence-with-legacy-package.md)), not a drop-in replacement.

This repository is in **Development**. Nothing described here is published, tagged, or installable through Packagist or any other Composer distribution channel.

## Key Features

- **Transaction** — `PdoTransactionRunner` / `PdoSavepointTransactionRunner`: participate in a caller's active transaction (using a savepoint when one is needed) or own a new transaction; fail-closed on a `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` that returns `false` instead of throwing; optional bounded (0–3) deadlock replay for a package-owned transaction, off by default.
- **Pagination** — `PdoPaginator::paginate()`: normalizes untrusted `page`/`perPage`/sort input, runs two independent count queries plus a bounded, sorted data query, and returns a validated `PageResultDTO` (array/JSON-serializable).
- **Ordering** — `ScopedOrderingManager`: global, scoped, or nullable-scoped integer ordering with a plain next-position read, a locking next-position read for inserts, and a locked, clamped, savepoint-protected `moveWithinScope()`.
- Host-agnostic: no connection factory, no schema ownership, no ORM, no HTTP/host logic. The host owns the `PDO` connection, the tables, and their meaning.

## Requirements

Declared in [`composer.json`](composer.json), which is the governing reference:

- PHP `^8.4`
- `ext-pdo`, `ext-pdo_mysql`
- `maatify/exceptions ^1.0`

These are declared runtime requirements, not a statement that any specific database version is supported or verified — see [Database support](#database-support) below.

## Installation

This package is **not published**. It has no Packagist listing, no Git tag, and no installable version; `composer require maatify/php-persistence` does not resolve anything today. The intended Composer identity is `maatify/php-persistence` once a release exists; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the current `[Unreleased]` state.

## Usage

Every capability takes a `PDO` connection the host already created and owns. A minimal Transaction example:

```php
<?php

use Maatify\PhpPersistence\Transaction\Repository\PdoTransactionRunner;

$runner = new PdoTransactionRunner($pdo); // $maxDeadlockRetries defaults to 0 (no replay)

$orderId = $runner->run(function () use ($pdo): int {
    $pdo->prepare('INSERT INTO orders (customer_id) VALUES (:customer_id)')
        ->execute(['customer_id' => 42]);

    return (int) $pdo->lastInsertId();
});
```

See [docs/guides/USAGE_GUIDE.md](docs/guides/USAGE_GUIDE.md) for a capability map covering Transaction, Pagination, and Ordering, each with its own `Input → Public Call → Result → Boundary` walkthrough, and [examples/](examples/) for complete, runnable scripts.

## Public Runtime API

The public surface is three independent capability namespaces under `Maatify\PhpPersistence\`:

- `Transaction\Repository\{TransactionRunnerInterface, SavepointTransactionRunnerInterface, PdoTransactionRunner, PdoSavepointTransactionRunner}` and `Transaction\Exception\{InvalidTransactionConfigurationException, TransactionExecutionException}`.
- `Pagination\{Criteria\PageRequest, Config\PaginationConfig, ValueObject\SortWhitelist, Criteria\PdoPaginationQueryDescriptor, Repository\PdoPaginator, DTO\PageResultDTO, Enum\SortDirectionEnum}` and `Pagination\Exception\{InvalidPaginationConfigurationException, InvalidPaginationQueryException, PaginationExecutionException}`.
- `Ordering\{Config\ScopedOrderingConfig, Repository\ScopedOrderingManager}` and `Ordering\Exception\{InvalidOrderingConfigurationException, InvalidOrderingOperationException}`.
- One package-wide exception marker: `Exception\PhpPersistenceExceptionInterface`.

Two internal helper classes (`Transaction\Repository\{OwnedTransactionExecutor, SavepointScope}`) are reachable but are explicitly **not** part of the public contract or SemVer.

The complete, verified inventory — every constructor, named parameter, default, return type, thrown exception, and behavioral guarantee — is the canonical [PHP_PERSISTENCE_PACKAGE_REFERENCE.md](PHP_PERSISTENCE_PACKAGE_REFERENCE.md). This section is an overview only and is not repeated there in full.

## Critical Runtime Behavior

- **Caller-owned vs. package-owned transactions:** every runner and `moveWithinScope()` participates in an already-active transaction without ever beginning, committing, or finally rolling it back; it only owns a transaction (and may then retry on deadlock) when none was already active. See [Package Reference §4 and §7](PHP_PERSISTENCE_PACKAGE_REFERENCE.md#4-ownership-vocabulary).
- **Pagination's three statements are not one snapshot** outside a caller-owned transaction; `total` and `filtered` can disagree under concurrent writes unless the caller wraps the call in its own transaction. See [Package Reference §5.3](PHP_PERSISTENCE_PACKAGE_REFERENCE.md#53-pdopaginatorpaginate).
- **MariaDB `innodb_snapshot_isolation=ON`** can make a locking Ordering read fail with driver error `1020` after the server has already rolled back the caller's whole transaction. This is a documented hazard, not a handled case: no retry, no savepoint recovery, and no setting change is attempted. See [Package Reference §7.3](PHP_PERSISTENCE_PACKAGE_REFERENCE.md#73-mariadb-innodb_snapshot_isolation-hazard).
- Deadlock replay is opt-in, bounded to 3 attempts, and applies only to a package-owned transaction under the exact SQLSTATE `40001`/driver-code `1213` signature.

## Exception and Error Propagation

Every exception the package defines implements `Exception\PhpPersistenceExceptionInterface`, so a consumer can catch all package-defined failures with one type. `\PDOException` and any other external `\Throwable` — including one thrown by the caller's own callback — propagate through every public method **unchanged** and do not implement that marker. See [Package Reference §6](PHP_PERSISTENCE_PACKAGE_REFERENCE.md#6-exceptions-reference) for the full exception table and the inherited `maatify/exceptions` constructor shape.

## Security and Trust Boundaries

Table and column identifiers passed to `ScopedOrderingConfig` and sort-key identifier paths passed to `SortWhitelist` are validated and quoted, but they are **not** bound as PDO parameters (SQL does not allow binding identifiers) — they must be trusted application constants, never raw user input. Row ids, scope values, order numbers, and pagination filter/sort values are always bound as PDO parameters.

## Examples

Runnable, Public-API-only examples live in [examples/](examples/): one each for Transaction, Pagination, and Ordering. Every example requires a real MySQL/MariaDB connection and is validated in CI using this repository's existing Integration infrastructure (no example invents a second database stack).

## Database support

Neither MySQL nor MariaDB has a declared "supported range" today; both are design targets. The Transaction, Pagination, and Ordering capabilities' own tests (not just infrastructure checks) pass against specific named versions — MySQL `8.0.16`, `8.4.13`, `9.7.4`, and MariaDB `10.11.19`, `11.4.13`, `11.8.9`, `12.3.3` — which is "version tested" evidence, narrower than a declared "range verified" claim. See [docs/architecture/DATABASE_SUPPORT_AND_TEST_POLICY.md](docs/architecture/DATABASE_SUPPORT_AND_TEST_POLICY.md) §1 for what each term means and [PHP_PERSISTENCE_PACKAGE_REFERENCE.md §8](PHP_PERSISTENCE_PACKAGE_REFERENCE.md#8-database-engine-support) for the current, verified claim.

## Quality Status

PHPStan runs at level `max` with zero errors (no baseline, no `ignoreErrors`). Code style follows PHP-FIG PER Coding Style 3.1, mechanically verified. Unit, Regression, and Integration suites all pass; the Integration suite exercises the Transaction, Pagination, and Ordering capabilities themselves (including genuine deadlocks, a deterministic concurrent-writer snapshot test, and real stale-snapshot concurrency) against the named database versions above, on PHP 8.4 and 8.5, with both latest and lowest compatible dependencies. See the current CI run for exact, unfrozen figures rather than a count copied into this file.

## Development and Testing

```bash
composer analyse        # PHPStan level max
composer format:check   # PER-CS 3.1, non-mutating
composer test:unit      # no Docker needed
composer test:regression
composer test:integration   # needs Docker; starts a disposable MySQL/MariaDB service
composer examples:smoke     # needs Docker; smoke-executes examples/ against a real engine
```
