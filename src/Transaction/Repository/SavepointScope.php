/**
 * Operation-local savepoint inside a transaction the caller already owns:
 * `SAVEPOINT`, `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` and `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`, with the
 * best-effort cleanup order and exception precedence that
 * {@see PdoSavepointTransactionRunner} characterizes (DEC-011 item 3).
 *
 * - {@see self::releaseOrUndo()} is the success path: RELEASE, or best-effort
 *   cleanup followed by the RELEASE failure when it fails.
 * - {@see self::cleanupAfterFailure()} is the failure path: best-effort
 *   ROLLBACK TO and RELEASE after the caller's own failure (a thrown
 *   Throwable, or a failed RELEASE); the caller's own failure always wins over
 *   a cleanup failure.
 * - {@see self::undoOrFail()} is for a caller that reports failure without
 *   throwing: ROLLBACK TO must succeed, and its failure is not swallowed;
 *   RELEASE afterwards is best effort. This shape exists so a future
 *   non-callback consumer (Ordering, where a failed move returns `false`
 *   instead of throwing) can reuse this helper without a second
 *   implementation; it is not called by this capability's own runner.
 *
 * It never begins, commits, fully rolls back or retries the caller-owned
 * transaction, and never retries the savepoint itself.
 *
 * @internal Shared mechanism of the savepoint runner; not part of the public API.
