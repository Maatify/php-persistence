/**
 * Runs a callback with an operation-local savepoint inside an existing PDO
 * transaction, and owns the transaction (with optional deadlock replay) when
 * no transaction is active.
 *
 * - No active transaction: the same owned-transaction behavior as
 *   PdoTransactionRunner, including the optional replay of the whole owned
 *   transaction after a MySQL deadlock (SQLSTATE 40001, driver code 1213), at
 *   most $maxDeadlockRetries times, when the end of the transaction is
 *   attributed to that deadlock, and the same fail-closed handling of a BEGIN
 *   or COMMIT that returns false (TransactionExecutionException). No savepoint
 *   SQL is issued on this path.
 * - Active caller-owned transaction: creates an operation-local savepoint
 *   (maatify_persistence_sp_<32 lowercase hex>) through {@see SavepointScope},
 *   releases it on success and rolls back to it (best effort) on failure. It
 *   never commits, fully rolls back or retries the caller-owned transaction or
 *   the savepoint, even on a deadlock; the callback Throwable (or RELEASE
 *   failure) always wins over cleanup failures.
 *
 * Replay re-executes the WHOLE callback of an owned transaction. Its effects
 * outside this PDO connection are not rolled back and would be repeated; keep
 * them outside the callback or make them idempotent. The callback must not
 * begin, commit or roll back the runner-owned transaction itself, or commit it
 * implicitly: keeping it intact is a mandatory precondition of replay.
